    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(capacity), for hashmap and linkedlist
    * The HashMap and DLinkedList work independently of each other, although they hold kind of the same data.
    *
    * We use the hash map to hold a pointer to the place where the data with a given key is stored. This reference
    * can be used to use the DLinkNode.
    *
    * For example, if we want to get the element with key 5, we first use the HashMap to get a pointer to the
    * memory location of where the data with key 5 is stored. With this reference we can then get node.value and
    * move it to the head of the DLinkNode
    *
    * Add a node to a DLinkNode:
    * We only modify the pointers inside head and node, we don't reallocate the pointers towards head or tail.
    * Think of the list as going head <=> tail, all nodes will be inserted before the head.
    *
    * In the first step, we focus on allocating the new node's pointers:
    * node.prev = head
    * node.next = head.next (we cannot link the node.next to tail, as there might be nodes between)
    *
    * Then we need to reallocate the connections between head and it's previous element, towards the new node:
    * head.next.prev = node (head.next is head's previous element, so we change it's prev pointer towards the new node)
    * head.next = node
    *
