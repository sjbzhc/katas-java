/*
* Time: O(m log n)
* Space: O(n)
* The trick lies in sorting the array. This way, any new node we encounter, we can add it to the disjoint set without
* having to check if that would make the graph more expensive, as we know it's the cheapest option.
*
* A new pair of nodes, with nodes already connected to the graph, will be skipped, as it does not add any value to the
* graph.
*
* The weights in the disjoint set are used to determine how many components are connected with the current node's parent.
* We want to attach to the one with the highest weight, as it means we increase the graph's size.
*
* At the beginning we have a disjoint set, where all nodes are their own parents. When we do a union, the node with the
* smallest weight get assigned a parent, the one with the higher weight.
*
* This is Krusakal's algorithm
