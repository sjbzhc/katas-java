/*
* Time: O(N * 3^L): L = length of searched word, N: number of cells in board
* Space: O(L), due to recursion tree. Max length is length of the word
* Solution is linked to the depth of the recursion. If we manage to go as deep as the length of the word,
* it means we found a path with the necessary number of chars to build the string.
*
* For each of the chars in the board, we try to do backtracking.
*
* In backtracking we return false if the current char does not match what we expect: board[row][col] != word.charAt(index)
*
* If it matches, we continue, meaning we have been so far in a promising path. Then we try backtracking for all of the
* neighbors of the current cell.
*
* More calls to backtrack will be executed until we reach the desired depth d (which can only be achieved after traversing
* d adequate nodes).
*
* If all of the chars in the path return true, we clean after ourselves, putting back the char in the
* board: board[row][col] = word.charAt(index) (the recursive calls did this before reaching the calling place in the stack).
*
* letterFound is necessary to only stay in the correct path.
