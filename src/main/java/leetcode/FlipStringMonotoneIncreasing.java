/*
* Time: O(N)
* Space: O(N)
*
* We separate for each element the left and right side.
*
* In the left side, we count the number of ones, since we want to have only 0s.
*
* In the right side (including the current element) we count the 1s.
* The calculation is (n-j) - (P[n] - P[j]) since we are interested in 0s, not 1s, and P counts 1s.
*
* We first take the range and subtract the delta of 1s between the last and current elements (which is the number
* of 1s in the range).
*
* If the range is 3, and we had 3 ones at the start and end of the range, it means we don't have any new 1s, so we have
* 3 zeros.
