/*
* Time: O(n * L^3): L has 2 nested loops of length of longest word, + substring
* Space: O(n + L)
*
* The main part is in canForm.
*
* A boolean array is created with the size of the word + 1. For example, for abc, with the first element as true:
*
* With subWords: {ab, c}
* characterChecks = [1,0,0,0]
* Then we have nested loop, to check all substrings of the word in the subWords set.
* If a portion of the word is encountered, we set the end of the substring in the word to true. In this case, we find
* ab, so we set:
* characterChecks = [1,0,1,0]
* Then we encounter c, so we set:
* characterChecks = [1,0,1,1]
*
* We speed up the process of going through the different substrings by breaking in the case that charactersCheck[end] is
* false. This was, we move the start counter quicker (as we don't have to wait for start to increment all the way up to end).
*
* We return the value in the last position of the array.
