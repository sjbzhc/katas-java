    *         r = lca(null, 9, 20) => null

    *         l = lca(null, 9, 20) => null
    *         r = lca(null, 9, 20) => null

    *   l != null && r != null => return root
    *
    * We first create the whole recursion tree (up to the point where we need it) and then the results start to be
    * generated with the leaves of the tree for each node.
    *
    * We only reach left != null && right != null when all the children of left and right were evaluated and they were
    * only returned as set.contains(root) for their own call to lca (e.g. lca(20,0,20))
    *
    * This calls left and right for 9. Since 9 as a root is included in the set of (p,q), 9 is returned.
    * For 20, we calculate left and right for 15, which return null. This will lead to a result of null. The same for 7.
    * Since set (p,q) contains 20, we return 20.
