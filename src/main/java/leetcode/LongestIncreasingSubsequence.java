/*
* Time: O(n2)
* Space: O(n)
*
* dp represents the length of the longest consecutive arr for index i
* we calculate from right to left, so we want the max of the solution at i (new) or at j adding 1 (older + this cell)
*
* In the tree, a leaf represents the number length of the sequence for a particular index. So for example we have a leaf
* for index 2 and we know that the last element we can add is x, we don't need to recalculate later when we encounter
* index 2 again, as we know it's value already
*
* We notice that we need to reach leafs until we start saving in our cache, that indicates this can be done with
* bottoms up DP
* 0 1 2 3
* 1 2 4 3
* start
*   rc(0):1
*       rc(1):1 2
*           rc(2):1 2 4 -> we only increase by 1 when we reach index 2
*           rc(3):1 2 5 -> we only increase by 1 when we reach index 3
*       rc(2):5
*       rc(3):4
*   rc(1):2
* Brute force: at each step in the decision tree, we have 2 choices, so 2^n total leafs
* Add memo
