/*
* We need a base case. In this case, we return 1 because it means we reached the end of the rows, so we must have
* found one possible placement for all queens (we only reach a valid option, as otherwise we would run into the
* continue within the loop).
*
* To create the recursion tree, we iterate through all possible options. In this case it means increasing the column,
* since the row number is contained as an argument in the function.
*
* If we encounter a valid option, we:
*   update the state by adding constrains (cols, diags and antidiags).
*   recursively call that option, which will generate all possible paths for it.
*   after calling backtrack, we must go back to the previous state (this is the actual backtracking), by removing the
*   cols, diags and antidiags we just added. This leaves a clean state for the next round of the loop.
*
*
* Summarized:
* Follow a path until it branches.
* In the branch, follow each of the paths. Need to know how to come back, so keep track of the state, so you can reverse
* it to come back to where you started.
